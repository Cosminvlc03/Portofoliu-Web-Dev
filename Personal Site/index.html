            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>I am/was a student(depending on when you are reading this) at UPT's Computer and Information's Technology.</p>
            <p> I'm also a web developer who loves good food and a hot coffee.</p>

            <p id="p1">My passion for web development came when I was in highschool, while my passion for computers came when I probably didn't know how ride a bike yet. I attended the mentioned faculty, and also started learning web dev by taking an online course.A full(probably still in work) CV can be found <a href="./CV/index.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="h32">My personal skills</h3>
            <img class="photo_2" src="./assets/pasta.jfif" alt="pasta">
            <p id="p2">On the personal side, I could probably talk for days about what I like doing. But cooking surely is my strong arm, because just like with programming, is a skill that takes time to learn but enables you to be creative with what you do.(Sidenote, I make a pasta dish that would blow your minds) </p>

            <h3>I'll be happy to talk with you about everything.</h3>
            <p>But I tell you, if you want to know my recipe, you will want to talk with me. Better yet, maybe we will learn something together.</p>
